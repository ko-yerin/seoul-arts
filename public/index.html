              <p>In scientific and political fields today, the challenges facing humanity demand unprecedented
                levels of global, intercultural cooperation. As artists, we aspire to work in a similar spirit, drawing
                on the light-speed web of fiber optic nerves spread across our planet to create a trans-locational
                stage and activate it with new intercultural musical expressions.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>In collaboration with a team of visual designers and technologists, an ensemble of ten Korean
                and American improvisers split across our two sites will premiere new musical compositions that
                manifest our shared artistic affinities, in this latest collaborative effort to project our highest
                sonic
                aspirations.</p>

              Kim Keunhyoung is an AI artist, researcher, and programmer. He is one of the two artists of
              Slitscope, an AI-inspired media art group. Through his work he raises a question about the
              blurred lines between artificial intelligence and human from a perspective of art and creativity,
              which ultimately leads to another question about ‘what makes humans human.’ As he majored
              in deep learning and music information retrieval at KAIST where he got his Ph. D., he has
              created and developed most of the models and programs used in Slitscope’s pieces.
